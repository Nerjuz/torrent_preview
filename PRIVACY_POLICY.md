# Privacy Policy for Torrent Posters Preview

**Last Updated:** December 29, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the **Torrent Posters Preview** extension collects, uses, and discloses information, and what choices you have with respect to the information.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

**We do not collect any personal information.**

This extension operates entirely on your local device. It is designed to enhance your browsing experience on `torrent.lt`, `torrent.ai` and `linkomanija.net` by displaying poster images.

### Data We Process locally:
-   **Image URLs:** The extension fetches public details pages from the supported torrent sites to find the URL of the movie/game poster.
-   **Cached Data:** To improve performance and reduce network requests, the extension stores these image URLs in your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`). This data is stored only on your device and is never sent to us or any third parties.
-   **Settings:** Your preference for enabling/disabling the preview feature is stored locally.

## 2. Third-Party Services

Relationship with Target Sites:
The extension makes HTTP requests directly from your browser to:
-   `https://torrent.lt`
-   `https://torrent.ai`
-   `http://88.80.28.26`
-   `https://www.linkomanija.net`

These requests are necessary to retrieve the poster images. The privacy policies of these respective websites apply to the traffic generated by these requests, just as if you had visited the pages yourself.

## 3. Data Retention

The extension stores cache data (image URLs) in your browser's local storage. You can clear this data at any time by:
1.  Using the "Clear Cache" button in the extension's popup menu.
2.  Uninstalling the extension.

## 4. Updates to this Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of this policy.
